# VHDL projects
This repository showcases a variety of digital circuit designs, ranging from basic logic circuits to advanced systems. Each project is accompanied by VHDL code, testbenches, schematics, explanatory images, and personal insights.

Projects Included:

1. Carry Lookahead Adder
   
   A high-speed adder design using carry lookahead logic to enhance the performance of multi-bit addition.
   
2. Multiplier with a Modified Full Adder
   
   An optimized multiplier design that integrates a custom full adder for efficient computation.
   
3. ECG Filter
   
   An implementation of an IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filter to process ECG signals, demonstrating real-world applications of digital signal processing in VHDL.
   
4. Assembler-Based Division Algorithm

   This project explores assembler-style programming in VHDL to perform the division of 16-bit and 8-bit binary numbers. The goal was to create a division algorithm for a 16-bit quotient using two 8-bit registers: one for the LSB (Least Significant Bit) and one for the MSB (Most Significant Bit). The project focused on modifying the provided ROM file to adapt it for the division task, with a total of 20 commands given in the provided Instruction Set PDF. Other parts of the code remain unchanged, as they are part of the copyright, and thus are not included. My task was solely to modify the ROM file and adapt it to the division task.
